	# > If you're creating external commands, you don't even need aliases. If `git foo` isn't recognized by git, it will look for `git-foo` in your $PATH and run it. In fact some of the "core" git tools are written like this, see ls -l /usr/lib/git-core for which ones aren't symlinks to /usr/bin/git, many of them are shell or perl scripts.
